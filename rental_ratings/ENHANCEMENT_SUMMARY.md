- Read-only system fields
- Performance optimizations

## ðŸ“Š New API Capabilities

### Backend-Side Filtering Examples
```bash
# Filter by rating range
GET /api/rental-ratings/ratings/?min_rating=4&max_rating=5

# Filter by verified purchases only
GET /api/rental-ratings/ratings/?verified_only=true

# Filter by date range
GET /api/rental-ratings/ratings/?recent_only=true

# Advanced search with multiple criteria
GET /api/rental-ratings/ratings/search_advanced/?q=excellent&verified_only=true&date_range=month
```

### Statistics and Analytics
```bash
# Get item statistics
GET /api/rental-ratings/ratings/statistics/?item_id=uuid

# Get user statistics
GET /api/rental-ratings/ratings/statistics/?user_id=uuid

# Get global statistics
GET /api/rental-ratings/ratings/statistics/
```

### Item-Specific Data
```bash
# Get all ratings for an item with details
GET /api/rental-ratings/ratings/by_item/?item_id=uuid
```

## ðŸš€ Performance Benefits

### 1. Reduced Frontend Processing
- All filtering happens on the backend
