- `GET /ratings/search_advanced/` - Advanced search
- `GET /ratings/statistics/` - Rating statistics
- `GET /ratings/by_item/` - Item-specific ratings

## Usage Examples

### Mobile App Integration

#### 1. Get Filtered Ratings
```javascript
// Get high-rated verified purchases
const response = await fetch('/api/rental-ratings/ratings/?min_rating=4&verified_only=true&sort_by=recent');
const ratings = await response.json();
```

#### 2. Advanced Search
```javascript
// Search for excellent reviews in the last month
const response = await fetch('/api/rental-ratings/ratings/search_advanced/?q=excellent&date_range=month&verified_only=true');
const results = await response.json();
```

#### 3. Get Item Statistics
```javascript
// Get comprehensive stats for an item
const response = await fetch('/api/rental-ratings/ratings/statistics/?item_id=item-uuid');
const stats = await response.json();
```

#### 4. Create Rating
```javascript
const ratingData = {
  item_id: 'item-uuid',
  rating: 5,
  comment: 'Excellent rental experience!',
  is_verified_purchase: true
};

const response = await fetch('/api/rental-ratings/ratings/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(ratingData)
});
```

## Model Fields

### Rating Model
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `item_id` - UUID of the rental item
- `user` - Foreign key to User
- `rating` - Integer (1-5)
- `comment` - Text field
- `created_at` - DateTime
- `updated_at` - DateTime
- `is_verified_purchase` - Boolean
- `helpful_votes` - Integer
- `reported` - Boolean
- `is_edited` - Boolean

## Database Indexes
The system includes optimized database indexes for:
- `item_id + rating` - Fast rating filtering
- `user + created_at` - User rating history
- `rating + created_at` - Rating-based sorting
- `is_verified_purchase + rating` - Verified rating queries

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Query Optimization
- `select_related` for user and profile data
- `prefetch_related` for related objects
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient aggregation queries

### 2. Caching Strategy
- Statistics can be cached on the client side
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Combine filters to reduce API calls

### 3. Rate Limiting
- 1000 requests per hour per user
- 100 requests per minute per user
- 10 requests per second burst limit

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
python manage.py test rental_ratings.test_enhanced_features
```

### Test Coverage
- Model functionality
- API endpoints
- Filtering and search
- Statistics calculation

## Management Commands

### Update Rating Statistics
```bash
# Update all items
python manage.py update_rating_statistics

# Update specific item
python manage.py update_rating_statistics --item-id item-uuid

# Batch processing
python manage.py update_rating_statistics --batch-size 50
